# df-docker
Docker container for DreamFactory 2.0.

# Prerequisites

## Get Docker
- See: [https://docs.docker.com/installation](https://docs.docker.com/installation)

### Get Docker Compose (optional)
- See [https://docs.docker.com/compose/install](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install)

### Using MS SQL?
The Docker image we provide does not include PHP drivers for MS SQL. If you need this functionality add the following to the 'apt-get install' line in the Dockerfile and build yourself a new image using the steps below.

# Configuration method 1 (use Docker Hub Image)

## 1) Clone the df-docker repo
`cd ~/repos` (or wherever you want the clone of the repo to be)  
`git clone https://github.com/dreamfactorysoftware/df-docker.git`  
`cd df-docker`

## 2) Edit .env file (optional)
The application looks for a `.env` file to read its configuration. The default settings should be sufficient in most cases, but you can adjust the settings to your needs. When starting the container you have to add the file to the container using the option `-v /PATH_TO_ENV_FILE:/opt/dreamfactory/.env`.

## 3) Pull DreamFactory image
`docker pull dreamfactorysoftware/df-docker`

## 4) Ensure that the database container is created and running
`docker run -d --name df-mysql -e "MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root" -e "MYSQL_DATABASE=dreamfactory" -e "MYSQL_USER=df_admin" -e "MYSQL_PASSWORD=df_admin" mysql`

## 5) Start the dreamfactorysoftware/df-docker container with linked MySQL server or with external MySQL server  
If your database runs inside another container you can simply link it under the name `db`.  
  
`docker run -d -p 127.0.0.1:80:80 --name dreamfactory -v /PATH_TO_ENV_FILE:/opt/dreamfactory/.env --link df-mysql:db dreamfactorysoftware/df-docker`

`docker exec dreamfactory php artisan key:generate`

`docker restart dreamfactory`

## 6) Add an entry to /etc/hosts
127.0.0.1 dreamfactory.app

## 7) Access the app
Go to 127.0.0.1 in your browser. It will take some time the first time. You will be asked to create your first admin user.

# Configuration method 2 (use docker-compose)
The easiest way to configure the DreamFactory application is to use docker-compose.

## 1) Clone the df-docker repo
`cd ~/repos` (or wherever you want the clone of the repo to be)  
`git clone https://github.com/dreamfactorysoftware/df-docker.git`  
`cd df-docker`

## 2) Edit `docker-compose.yml` (optional)

## 3) Edit .env file (optional)
The application looks for a `.env` file to read its configuration. The default settings should be sufficient in most cases, but you can adjust the settings to your needs.

## 4) Build images
`docker-compose build`

## 5) Start containers
`docker-compose up -d`

## 6) Add an entry to /etc/hosts
`127.0.0.1 dreamfactory.app`

## 7) Access the app
Go to 127.0.0.1 in your browser. It will take some time the first time. You will be asked to create your first admin user.

# Configuration method 3 (build your own)
If you don't want to use docker-compose you can build the images yourself.

## 1) Clone the df-docker repo
`cd ~/repos` (or wherever you want the clone of the repo to be)  
`git clone https://github.com/dreamfactorysoftware/df-docker.git`  
`cd df-docker`

## 2) Edit .env file (optional)
The application looks for a `.env` file to read its configuration. The default settings should be sufficient in most cases, but you can adjust the settings to your needs. When starting the container you have to add the file to the container using the option `-v /PATH_TO_ENV_FILE:/opt/dreamfactory/.env`.

## 3) Build dreamfactory/v2 image
`docker build -t dreamfactory/v2 .`  

## 4) Ensure that the database container is created and running
`docker run -d --name df-mysql -e "MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root" -e "MYSQL_DATABASE=dreamfactory" -e "MYSQL_USER=df_admin" -e "MYSQL_PASSWORD=df_admin" mysql`

## 5) Start the dreamfactory/v2 container with linked MySQL server or with external MySQL server  
If your database runs inside another container you can simply link it under the name `db`.  
  
`docker run -d -p 127.0.0.1:80:80 -v /PATH_TO_ENV_FILE:/opt/dreamfactory/.env --link df-mysql:db dreamfactory/v2`  
  
or  
  
`docker run -d -p 127.0.0.1:80:80 -v /PATH_TO_ENV_FILE:/opt/dreamfactory/.env dreamfactory/v2`

## 6) Add an entry to /etc/hosts
127.0.0.1 dreamfactory.app

## 7) Access the app
Go to 127.0.0.1 in your browser. It will take some time the first time. You will be asked to create your first admin user.

# Notes
- PATH_TO_ENV_FILE must be an absolute path on your file system like `/home/todd/repos/df-docker/.env`.
- You may have to use `sudo` for Docker commands depending on your setup.
