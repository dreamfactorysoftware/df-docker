# Prerequisites

## Get Docker
- See: [https://docs.docker.com/installation](https://docs.docker.com/installation)

### Get Docker Compose (optional)
- See [https://docs.docker.com/compose/install](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install)

## Environment options
- See [this table](#environment-options-1)

# Configuration method 1a (use docker-compose)
The easiest way to configure the DreamFactory application is to use docker-compose.

## 1) Clone the df-docker repo
`cd ~/repos` (or wherever you want the clone of the repo to be)  
`git clone https://github.com/dreamfactorysoftware/df-docker.git`  
`cd df-docker`

## 2) Edit `docker-compose.yml` (optional)

## 3) Build images
`docker-compose build`

## 4) Start containers
`docker-compose up -d`

    NOTE: volume df-storage:/opt/dreamfactory/storage is created to store all file based (apps, logs etc.) data from DreamFactory.
    This basically stores all data written by DreamFactory (at /opt/dreamfactory/storage location) in the df-storage volume. This 
    way if you delete your DreamFactory container your data will persist as long as you don't delete the df-storage volume.
    
    to stop and remove all containers you can use the command 
    
        docker-compose down
    
    to stop and remove all containers including volumes use 
    
        docker-compose down -v
    
## 5) Add an entry to /etc/hosts
`127.0.0.1 dreamfactory.app`

## 6) Access the app
Go to 127.0.0.1 in your browser. It will take some time the first time. You will be asked to create your first admin user.

# Configuration method 1b (use docker-compose with load balancing)
The easiest way to configure the DreamFactory application is to use docker-compose.

## 1) Clone the df-docker repo
`cd ~/repos` (or wherever you want the clone of the repo to be)  
`git clone https://github.com/dreamfactorysoftware/df-docker.git`  
`cd df-docker`

## 2) Rename `docker-compose.yml-load-balance` to `docker-compose.yml`. Recommend backing up original `docker-compose.yml` first.

## 3) Build images
`docker-compose build`

## 4) Start containers
`docker-compose up -d`

    NOTE: volume df-storage:/opt/dreamfactory/storage is created to store all file based (apps, logs etc.) data from DreamFactory.
    This basically stores all data written by DreamFactory (at /opt/dreamfactory/storage location) in the df-storage volume. This 
    way if you delete your DreamFactory container your data will persist as long as you don't delete the df-storage volume.
    
    to stop and remove all containers you can use the command 
    
        docker-compose down
    
    to stop and remove all containers including volumes use 
    
        docker-compose down -v

This will create 4 containers. Mysql, Redis, DreamFactory, and Load Balancer container. 

## 5) Add an entry to /etc/hosts
`127.0.0.1 dreamfactory.app`

## 6) Access the app
Go to 127.0.0.1 in your browser. It will take some time the first time. You will be asked to create your first admin user.

## 7) Add additional web (DreamFactory) containers
`docker-compose --scale web=3`

This will add two more DreamFactory container. Now the load balancer is going to balance load in a round-robin fashion among these three DreamFactory containers.

# Configuration method 2 (build your own)
If you don't want to use docker-compose you can build the images yourself.

## 1) Clone the df-docker repo
`cd ~/repos` (or wherever you want the clone of the repo to be)  
`git clone https://github.com/dreamfactorysoftware/df-docker.git`  
`cd df-docker`

## 2) Build dreamfactory/v2 image
`docker build -t dreamfactory .`  

## 3) Ensure that the database container is created and running
`docker run -d --name df-mysql -e "MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root" -e "MYSQL_DATABASE=dreamfactory" -e "MYSQL_USER=df_admin" -e "MYSQL_PASSWORD=df_admin" mysql`

## 4) Ensure that the redis container is created and running
`docker run -d --name df-redis redis`

## 5) Start the dreamfactorysoftware/df-docker container with linked MySQL and Redis server 
If your database and redis runs inside another container you can simply link it under the name `db` and `rd` respectively. 
  
`docker run -d --name df-web -p 80:80 -e "DB_DRIVER=mysql" -e "DB_HOST=db" -e "DB_USERNAME=df_admin" -e "DB_PASSWORD=df_admin" -e "DB_DATABASE=dreamfactory" -e "CACHE_DRIVER=redis" -e "CACHE_HOST=rd" -e "CACHE_DATABASE=0" -e "CACHE_PORT=6379" --link df-mysql:db --link df-redis:rd dreamfactory`

## 6) Add an entry to /etc/hosts
127.0.0.1 dreamfactory.app

## 7) Access the app
Go to 127.0.0.1 in your browser. It will take some time the first time. You will be asked to create your first admin user.

# Notes
- You may have to use `sudo` for Docker commands depending on your setup.
- By default, the container only sends nginx error logs to STDOUT. If you also want to have dreamfactory.log, e.g. for forwarding via docker logging driver
you can set environment variable `LOG_TO_STDOUT=true`

# Deploy container with DreamFactory commercial packages (silver / gold)

For this purpose we are assuming that you have already built your DreamFactory image named `dreamfactory` following instructions under the "Configuration method 2 (build your own)" section.

Start your MySQL container.

`docker run -d --name df-mysql -e "MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root" -e "MYSQL_DATABASE=dreamfactory" -e "MYSQL_USER=df_admin" -e "MYSQL_PASSWORD=df_admin" mysql`

Start your Redis container.

`docker run -d --name df-redis redis`

Now, in order for DreamFactory container to install the extra commercial packages after it starts up, you will need to provide the commercial license files to the container using docker volume.
To mount an external (host) directory inside docker container you can use the `-v` flag as part of the `docker run` command. For example: `-v /path/to/your/directory/on/host:/your/path/inside/container`.
For DreamFactory the container path for license file must be `/opt/dreamfactory/license`. In addition to setting the volume you will need to use the `LICENSE` environment option to indicate your license (silver/gold).

Here is an example command to start the DreamFactory container with gold license. Assuming your license files (provided by your sales agent) are stored in /Users/john/df-commercial.

`docker run -d --name df-web -p 80:80 -e "DB_DRIVER=mysql" -e "DB_HOST=db" -e "DB_USERNAME=df_admin" -e "DB_PASSWORD=df_admin" -e "DB_DATABASE=dreamfactory" -e "CACHE_DRIVER=redis" -e "CACHE_HOST=rd" -e "CACHE_DATABASE=0" -e "CACHE_PORT=6379" -e "LICENSE=gold" -v "/Users/john/df-commercial:/opt/dreamfactory/license" --link df-mysql:db --link df-redis:rd dreamfactory`


Once you attached the volume, as you have in your previous sets of commands, we still need to seed the databases, etc. 

First things first you need to get into your container.  You can do that by this command:

`docker exec -it <container name> /bin/bash/`

Note:  if you do not know the name of your container, you can use the command `docker ps` and it will list all of your running containers.

this will allow you to run commands inside of the container to update your files, etc.

1.`cp -i /opt/dreamfactory/license/composer.json /opt/dreamfactory` - When prompted type 'yes'

2.`cp -i /opt/dreamfactory/license/composer.lock /opt/dreamfactory` - When prompted type 'yes'

With the new values in place you need to install the dependencies:

Use `composer install --no-dev`  

or `composer install --no-dev --ignore-platform-reqs` if you do not need/want to install Oracle Drivers

Then you will need to run the normal seeding process:
`php artisan migrate --seed`

Clear your config:
`php artisan config:clear`

Clear you cache:
`php artisan cache:clear `

Reload your browser and you should see Gold or Silver for the license level
